Hi, my name is Jo√£o Moreira. I'm a data scientist working for Cars.com currently developing real-time recommendation systems to help users find the vehicle that best suits them.

I have a PhD from Northwestern University. My research involved quantifying the effect of gender diversity in creative (scientific and film) teams. I found that work by more diverse teams tends to have a higher impact, and that concentration of power in small homogeneous groups of leaders can lead to an overall gender discrimination. I have also created a simple, yet principled system to evaluate scientific impact called [foreCite](http://forecite.us/).

I am always eager to tackle challenging data science or machine learning problems and learning new skills.
Here's a random assortment of stuff I know something about:

* Data analysis in `Python` and `R`
* Building machine learning models
* Finding cool datasets to analyze
* Building websites in `Django` and `Pelican`
* Creating MongoDB and MySQL databases

You can find a full breakdown of my skills and experience [here]({filename}/pages/cv.md).

When I'm not working or obsessing about some new skill or technique, I like to explore the seemingly never-ending culinary options of Chicago, read Iron Man comics and science fiction novels, and re-watch Seinfeld episodes.

This website is built with [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) using my own custom version of the [pelican-hyde](https://github.com/jagmoreira/pelican-hyde) theme, originally by [jvanz](https://github.com/jvanz).
