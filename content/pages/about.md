Title: About
Date: 2016-12-16

Hi, my name is Jo√£o Moreira. I'm a budding data scientist from Portugal.
Since 2011 I have been at Northwestern University in Chicago doing my PhD in the
[Amaral Lab](https://amaral.northwestern.edu).

My research is in the cool field of *Science of Science*. Specifically, I work on quantifying the impact of scientific works and the effect of gender on creative (scientific and film) teams. I have created a simple, yet comprehensive indicator of impact called [foreCite](http://forecite.us/).

I am always eager to tackle challenging data science or machine learning problems and learning new skills.
Here's a random assortment of stuff I know something about:

* Data analysis in `Python` and `R`
* Building machine learning models
* (Legally!) scraping the web for cool datasets
* Building websites in `Django` and `Pelican`
* Creating MongoDB and MySQL databases
* Breaking and fixing Linux systems (So far break == fix)

You can find a full breakdown of my skills and experience [here]({filename}/pages/cv.md).

When I'm not working or obsessing about some new skill or technique, I like to explore the seemingly never-ending culinary options of Chicago, read Iron Man comics and science fiction novels, and re-watch Seinfeld episodes.

This website is built with [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) using my own custom version of the [pelican-hyde](https://github.com/jagmoreira/pelican-hyde) theme, originally by [jvanz](https://github.com/jvanz).
