Hi, my name is Jo√£o Moreira. I'm a budding data scientist from Portugal.
I'm currently looking for new opportunities in the data science scene in Chicago.

I have a PhD from Northwestern University. My research involved quantifying the effect of gender diversity in creative (scientific and film) teams. I found that work by more diverse teams tends to have a higher impact, and that concentration of power in small homogeneous groups of leaders can lead to an overall gender discrimination. I have also created a simple, yet principled system to evaluate scientific impact called [foreCite](http://forecite.us/).

I am always eager to tackle challenging data science or machine learning problems and learning new skills.
Here's a random assortment of stuff I know something about:

* Data analysis in `Python` and `R`
* Building machine learning models
* Finding cool datasets to analyze
* Building websites in `Django` and `Pelican`
* Creating MongoDB and MySQL databases
* Breaking and fixing Linux systems (So far break == fix)

You can find a full breakdown of my skills and experience [here]({filename}/pages/cv.md).

When I'm not working or obsessing about some new skill or technique, I like to explore the seemingly never-ending culinary options of Chicago, read Iron Man comics and science fiction novels, and re-watch Seinfeld episodes.
