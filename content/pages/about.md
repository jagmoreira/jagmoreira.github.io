Title: About
Date: 2016-12-16
Hi, my name is Jo√£o Moreira. I'm a budding data scientist from Portugal.
Since 2013 I have been at Northwestern University doing my PhD in the
[Amaral Lab](https://amaral.northwestern.edu).

My research is in the cool field of *Science of Science*. Specifically, I am currently studying how and why researchers cite each others work to build a simple, yet comprehensive bibliometric indicator of scientific performance.
This indicator is called [foreCite](http://forecite.us/).

I am always eager to learn new skills.
Here's a random assortment of stuff I know something about:

* Building websites in `Django` and `Pelican`
* Data analysis in `Python` and `R`
* Managing MongoDB and MySQL databases
* Breaking and fixing Linux systems (So far break == fix)

This website is built with [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) using my own custom version of the [pelican-hyde](https://github.com/jagmoreira/pelican-hyde) theme, originally by [jvanz](https://github.com/jvanz).
