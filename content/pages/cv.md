## Work experience

* [*Northwestern University*](http://www.northwestern.edu/). **Data Scientist & Instructor** (Jan. 2012 — Sep. 2017)
    * Used maximum likelihood estimation to parameterize the distribution of the impact of scientific publications (~1TB dataset)
    * Constructed a Django web application with interactive D3.js visualizations to showcase my data-driven ranking of scientific research: [http://forecite.us](http://forecite.us)
    * Demonstrated the existence of historical gender discrimination in the movie industry by performing time-series analysis on IMDb metadata of +15k movies
    * Created and delivered original course materials on web-scraping and object-oriented programming to over 100 students in 2 sessions of a 1-week long [Python programming bootcamp](https://amarallab.github.io/Introduction-to-Python-Programming-and-Data-Science/)
    * Organized and led discussion groups, and graded homeworks for all students in 4 undergraduate courses
    * Mentored 2 younger graduate students and 2 high-school interns on the principles of scientific research and basics of programming
* [*GadflyZone*](http://gadflyzone.com/). **Data Science Intern** (Apr. 2016 – Sep. 2016)
    * Constructed MySQL database of patents on Amazon Database Relational Services built from publicly available patent information
